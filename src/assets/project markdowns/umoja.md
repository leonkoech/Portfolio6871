# Umoja
## A Mental Health Support Platform

**Umoja** is a mental health support app designed to provide **free talk therapy** to individuals who cannot afford it, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. It leverages **crowdfunding** to provide therapy sessions through contributions from sponsors, who can either make monthly donations or contribute through a unique model where bank transaction roundups are converted into points. These points are then used to fund therapy sessions for those in need.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Crowdfunding Model:**
   - Sponsors (individuals or organizations) can choose to donate in two ways: **monthly contributions** or through **transaction-based contributions**. These flexible donation models make it easy for anyone, from individuals to corporate sponsors, to participate in supporting mental health services.
   - **Monthly Contributions**: Sponsors commit to a fixed amount each month, which is converted into points for therapy sessions.
   - **Per Transaction Contributions**: When a user makes a bank transaction, the difference between the transaction amount and the next dollar is rounded up. Half of that rounded-off amount is converted into points, which are used to sponsor therapy sessions.

2. **Point System:**
   - The point system adjusts dynamically based on the ratio of active patients to available therapists. This ensures that the resources are distributed equitably, with more points available as the number of users grows.
   - **Points Usage**: Points can be used by patients to access therapy sessions. The point exchange system ensures fair access to the resources, based on demand and available therapy providers.

3. **Therapist Network:**
   - Therapists registered on the platform can be matched to users based on need, availability, and specialization. As more sponsors contribute, more therapists are able to participate, expanding the capacity for providing therapy to those in need.
   - **Flexible Scheduling**: Therapists and users can arrange appointments at their convenience, with flexibility built into the platform to accommodate different time zones and schedules.

4. **User Experience:**
   - **Simple Onboarding**: Users sign up through an intuitive registration process and complete a short questionnaire to assess their mental health needs.
   - **Accessing Therapy**: Once registered, users can access a range of therapy options, including **video calls**, **voice calls**, or **text-based therapy**, depending on their preference and the availability of therapists.
   - **Privacy & Security**: The app places a strong emphasis on user confidentiality, with all therapy sessions encrypted to ensure that user data remains secure. 
   - **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their mental health progress over time, including changes in mood, stress levels, and overall well-being. This is complemented by analytics and insights that allow users to monitor their improvements and areas needing attention.

### **Impact and Potential Growth:**

- **Post-COVID Mental Health Crisis**: The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been significant, with millions of individuals facing anxiety, depression, and other challenges due to job loss, isolation, and financial stress. **Umoja** addresses this by offering accessible therapy to those who might otherwise be unable to afford it.
- **Global Reach**: While the app initially targets users in the United States, it has the potential to expand globally. As **Umoja** becomes open-source, international developers and organizations can adapt it for their local needs, ensuring a broader impact.
- **Expanding Therapist Networks**: By continuously increasing sponsorships and donations, **Umoja** can expand its network of certified therapists, allowing the app to scale and support more users. Partnerships with mental health organizations, universities, and other entities can further increase the availability of therapists.

### **Next Steps and Future Features:**

1. **Open-Source Development**:
   - **Umoja** will transition to an open-source project, inviting contributions from developers, mental health professionals, and community organizations to continuously improve the platform.
   - Open-source contributions will also enable customization for various regions, making it more adaptable to different cultural and language needs.

2. **Integration with Mental Health Services**:
   - The future roadmap for **Umoja** includes integration with existing **telemedicine platforms** and **therapy management systems**, allowing for seamless communication and data sharing between therapists and patients.
   - **Umoja** could also integrate with **mental health tools** like **mood trackers**, **self-help resources**, and **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** tools to provide a more holistic mental health solution.

3. **Charity and Government Partnerships**:
   - In the future, **Umoja** plans to collaborate with **charities**, **corporate sponsors**, and **government programs** to scale its services and reach a wider audience. By securing partnerships, the platform can leverage additional resources to provide free therapy to underserved communities.

4. **AI and Data-Driven Insights**:
   - The app will incorporate more **AI-driven features**, such as **personalized therapy recommendations** based on user data and feedback, which can help match users to the most suitable therapists.
   - The platform can also use **data analytics** to monitor user engagement, therapy effectiveness, and identify trends in mental health needs, helping to refine service delivery.

5. **Mobile Expansion**:
   - While **Umoja** is currently designed for mobile use, future updates will include **cross-platform support**, allowing users to access therapy services from **desktop** and **web-based interfaces**. This will improve accessibility, especially for users without access to smartphones.

### **Technologies and Tools:**
- **Cloud Storage**: To store user data and therapy sessions securely.
- **Dart & Flutter**: For developing cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Firebase**: Used for real-time database management, user authentication, and app backend services.
- **Google Cloud**: For scalable infrastructure to support the app as it grows.
