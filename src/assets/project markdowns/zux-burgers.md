## **Features**

### **Burger Customization (Frontend)**

- **JavaScript Integration**: ZuxBurgers allows customers to fully customize their burger orders using an interactive, JavaScript-based interface. Users can choose various ingredients and configurations for their burger, providing a personalized experience.

### **Real-time Notifications (Admin)**

- **Cloud Messaging**: ZuxBurgers utilizes **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to send real-time notifications to admins when a user places an order. These notifications are delivered directly to the mobile phones of the admin, ensuring they stay up-to-date with incoming orders without needing to monitor the website constantly.

### **Admin Control Panel (Mobile)**

- **Banner Messages**: Admins have the ability to send customized banner messages on the website through their mobile devices. This feature is designed to allow easy communication with customers, such as announcing special deals, promotions, or important notifications.
  
- **Order Tracking**: Admins can track the status of all current orders through the mobile app. This includes monitoring the payment status, delivery progress, and ensuring all orders are handled efficiently.

- **Invoice Management**: ZuxBurgers saves invoices in **Firebase** for easy access by the admin. When a user places an order, an invoice is automatically generated and stored in Firebase, allowing admins to access it on their mobile devices. This simplifies order management and provides a secure, cloud-based storage solution for all transactions.
