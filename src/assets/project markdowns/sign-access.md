## Problem Statement
Despite the rise of massive online open courses (MOOCs) and various video platforms, there is a notable gap in support for sign language. This affects 466 million people globally who use sign language as their primary mode of communication. While transcription and subtitles can aid comprehension, they often fall short for individuals who are not fluent readers.

### Challenges
- **High Computational Costs**: Existing solutions are resource-intensive, making them impractical for widespread use.
- **Platform Limitations**: Many services are limited to specific platforms (e.g., mobile apps).
- **Speed and Latency**: Slow processing times hinder real-time use.
- **Incomplete Solutions**: Existing platforms often only support text or voice-based input and lack comprehensive video-based sign generation.

## Technical Solution
SignAccess utilizes a sophisticated framework combining machine learning (ML) and computer vision algorithms to translate spoken or written content into sign language in real-time. This system is designed to work efficiently on local and web-based videos with minimal computational overhead.

### Core Technologies and Architecture
1. **Dynamic Gesture Generation Algorithm**:
   - **Audio Processing**: The audio is extracted from the video and processed locally or online to produce an accurate transcription.
   - **Keyword Extraction**: The transcription is analyzed for keyword relevance using natural language processing (NLP) models.
   - **Hand Landmark Mapping**: The algorithm retrieves hand joint coordinates to generate frame-by-frame gesture mappings, ensuring temporal accuracy.
   - **Landmark Centering**: Images are centered using the shoulder as a frame of reference, maintaining spatial consistency across frames.

2. **Gesture Interpolation and Rendering**:
   - **2D Sprite Rendering**: Hand landmarks are rendered as 2D sprites, optimized for speed and reduced latency.
   - **Smooth Transitions**: Interpolation techniques are applied to enhance the fluidity of gestures between frames, maintaining a natural appearance.

3. **Video Processing Pipeline**:
   - **Audio-to-Text Conversion**: Leveraging a hybrid approach of local and online transcription for robust audio processing.
   - **Joint Coordinate Extraction**: Real-time video frame analysis extracts joint coordinates with sub-millisecond latency.
   - **Pose Normalization**: The shoulder-based centering aligns the rendered gestures, ensuring a consistent frame of reference.

### Front-End Integration
**Browser Extension Features**:
- **Local and Online Video Support**: Users can upload or process web-hosted videos directly through the extension.
- **ASL Video Retrieval**: If a video has already been processed, the extension fetches the corresponding ASL video, reducing redundant processing.
- **User Customization**: Generated ASL videos can be customized for speed, size, and playback options.

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Scalable Database**: Stores processed ASL videos and links them with original video sources for seamless access.
- **High-Performance API**: Optimized for quick data retrieval and video processing, reducing load times and latency.
- **Security Measures**: Ensures safe storage and retrieval of video data, with encrypted connections and user authentication protocols.

## Advantages Over Existing Solutions
- **Low Computational Overhead**: SignAccess is significantly more efficient than traditional systems, requiring less CPU power while maintaining high accuracy (~95% on tested datasets).
- **Platform Independence**: The system can be used on various websites and supports local videos, making it highly versatile.
- **Research-Backed Algorithms**: Developed using cutting-edge research, ensuring a blend of accuracy, performance, and adaptability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlined extension that integrates easily into user workflows, offering quick access to ASL video translations.

## Future Development
- **AI-Driven Enhancement**: Continued refinement of ML models for improved gesture accuracy and expanded vocabulary.
- **Real-Time Processing Optimization**: Development of a cloud-based distributed processing system to support even larger-scale video processing tasks.
- **Feedback Loop Integration**: User feedback mechanisms to enhance the model's adaptability and accuracy over time.

## Market Potential and Growth
The global Language Service Provider (LSP) market was valued at $67.2 billion in 2022, with a projected rise to $98 billion by 2028, demonstrating a CAGR of 6.2%. The sign language interpretation sector is expected to grow by 8.5% annually, reaching $1.5 billion by 2032. SignAccess positions itself at the intersection of this expanding market, addressing the growing demand for digital inclusivity.
