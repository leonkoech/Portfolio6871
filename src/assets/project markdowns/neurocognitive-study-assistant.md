Our approach involves three key phases:

1. **Data Collection**: Neural data is gathered using a BCI-equipped headband.
2. **Algorithm Development**: Custom algorithms process and analyze the collected neural data.
3. **Web Application Development**: A user-friendly interface visualizes focus data and provides actionable insights.

## Key Features

- Real-time neural data collection and analysis
- Visualization of focus levels over study periods
- Identification of optimal study times based on neural activity
- User-friendly web interface for data interpretation

## Challenges

1. **Technical Limitations**: 
   - BCI headband compatibility limited to Android devices
   - Time constraints prevented implementation of personalized machine learning algorithms

2. **Data Handling**: 
   - Complex processing of neural data for accurate focus predictions
   - Integration of processed data into the web application

## Results and Accomplishments

- Successfully collected and processed neural data using BCI technology
- Developed robust algorithms for handling data anomalies
- Created a functional web application for visualizing focus data
- Established an effective collaborative team environment

## Future Development

1. **Enhanced Focus Reports**: Display topics with low focus percentages for targeted review
2. **User Interface Improvements**: Enhance usability and overall user experience
3. **Customization Options**: Implement personalized backgrounds and designs for increased engagement
4. **Machine Learning Integration**: Develop personalized algorithms for individual focus activities
