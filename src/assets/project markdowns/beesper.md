## A Virtual Reality Application for Learning American Sign Language (ASL)

Beesper is a Virtual Reality (VR) application designed to facilitate the learning of American Sign Language (ASL) through immersive and interactive experiences. This platform leverages cutting-edge VR technology, including the Leap Motion (Ultraleap) system, to track and provide real-time feedback on users' ASL gestures. Unlike traditional methods of ASL learning, Beesper enables users to practice sign language in a dynamic environment, enhancing both retention and engagement.
