# Tacti-sight

### "Enabling vision through sound"

Tacti-sight is a tactile haptic wearable system designed to empower visually impaired individuals by providing spatial awareness through ultrasonic sensors. It uses cutaneous input and haptic feedback via vibration on the fingers to recognize objects and navigate the environment.

## Problem Statement

Navigating and interacting with the physical world is a challenge for visually impaired individuals. This can limit their independence, quality of life, cause social isolation, and increase the risk of accidents. Everyday tasks like grocery shopping, traveling, and using public transportation can be difficult or impossible without assistance. Current tools, such as support canes and guide dogs, have limitations.

Tacti-sight provides a solution. By using ultrasonic sensors to offer tactile feedback, visually impaired individuals can perceive their surroundings through vibration on their fingers, aiding spatial awareness and improving mobility.

## Why Tactile Feedback

Haptic systems rely on sensory feedback through touch, enhancing interaction with the environment. Tacti-sight utilizes **cuticular inputs**, which engage the somatosensory system’s "what" and "where" subsystems to help users navigate their surroundings.

| **Subsystem** | **Function** |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| **What**      | Aids in perceiving objects and surfaces, essential for recognizing objects in the environment. |
| **Where**     | Provides spatial information, such as the location of objects in relation to the user’s position. |

## Advantages

| **Advantage**               | **Description**                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enhanced Tactile Perception** | Combines passive touch with active exploration, improving sensory awareness of both external objects and the user's tactile sensations. |
| **Remote Perception**        | Indirect haptic feedback eliminates the need for spatially distributed force feedback.                         |
| **Improved Spatial Acuity**  | Blind individuals often demonstrate superior spatial awareness, and Tacti-sight enhances this ability using the skin’s spatial resolution. |
| **Better Temporal Resolution** | Ultrasonic sound enhances the skin's temporal resolution without interfering with hearing.                   |
| **Geometric Recognition**    | Tacti-sight recognizes objects beyond the fingertip scale, helping users identify geometric shapes like tables and chairs. |
