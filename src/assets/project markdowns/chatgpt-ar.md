# Voice-Activated Task Management System for Students with Disabilities

The project aims to enhance the experience of students and individuals using ChatGPT, particularly focusing on those with disabilities. By streamlining the process of sending and receiving tasks, the system facilitates easier communication and interaction with ChatGPT through voice input and output. This approach was designed to provide greater accessibility and efficiency in completing tasks using voice commands.



## **Project Inspiration**

This project was conceived with the goal of improving the experience for students and individuals who rely on ChatGPT for task management. The inspiration came from the need to create a faster and more accessible way to send and receive tasks through ChatGPT, particularly for individuals with disabilities who may struggle with certain physical tasks. The aim was to bridge the gap by offering a solution that integrates voice commands to facilitate the completion of tasks efficiently and inclusively.



## **Core Functionality**

The system is designed to allow users to input tasks via voice, which are then converted into written text and sent to ChatGPT for processing. Once ChatGPT generates a response, the information is provided back to the user both in text and through an auditory output. This dual communication mode ensures accessibility for individuals with visual impairments and those who prefer auditory responses.

### **Key Features:**
- **Voice Input**: The system captures audio commands from the user, which are converted into text.
- **Text-to-Voice Output**: After processing the input, ChatGPT’s response is presented both as written text and an auditory output.
- **Integration with ChatGPT**: The system uses ChatGPT’s API to process user inputs and generate responses in real-time.
- **Virtual Text Box**: A virtual text box displays the textual representation of the received instructions and responses, allowing users to track and review their tasks.
- **Cloud Hosting**: The system is hosted on Google Cloud, ensuring reliable data processing and storage.



## **Technological Stack**

### **Tools and Technologies Used:**
- **Unity**: Used to develop the virtual environment for the system, integrating the Oculus platform for immersive interaction.
- **Flask**: A Python web framework used for managing the client-server architecture and handling communication between the user interface and backend services.
- **ChatGPT API**: The core AI engine used to process the user’s input and generate responses.
- **Google Cloud**: Provides the infrastructure to host the application and manage data storage.
- **Wit.ai**: Used for voice input recognition, translating audio commands into text.
- **Oculus VR**: Used to create an immersive virtual environment, enhancing user interaction through passthrough functionality.



## **Challenges Encountered**

### **Technical Hurdles**
1. **Google Cloud Integration**: Connecting Google Cloud to the system presented significant challenges, especially in configuring containers and dealing with unfamiliar setup procedures. The learning curve was steep and required considerable time and troubleshooting.
   
2. **Wit.ai Integration with Oculus**: Integrating Wit.ai with the Oculus platform posed another technical difficulty. The learning curve was steep, and it required extensive experimentation to ensure reliable voice input recognition within the virtual environment.
   
3. **Passthrough Functionality**: Implementing passthrough for Oculus proved to be challenging. The feature required precise calibration and testing, and at certain points, the functionality did not perform as expected.



## **Key Achievements**

### **Milestones and Successes**
- **Successfully Achieved Core Functionality**: Despite the technical challenges, we successfully developed a system where users can input tasks via voice and receive written and auditory responses from ChatGPT.
- **Enhanced Team Collaboration**: The project required collaboration across multiple disciplines, including programming, cloud infrastructure, and virtual reality development. We are proud of how well the team worked together, sharing knowledge and overcoming obstacles as a unit.
- **New Technical Skills**: Throughout the project, we gained hands-on experience with tools like Google Cloud, Wit.ai, and Unity, as well as how to integrate these technologies effectively.



## **Lessons Learned**

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Cloud Integration**: We learned the importance of properly configuring cloud services, particularly with Google Cloud, which was vital for managing the backend and hosting the application.
- **Voice Recognition**: The integration of Wit.ai with Oculus required a deeper understanding of voice recognition technology, and we gained valuable experience in this area.
- **Working with APIs**: The project helped us hone our skills in working with third-party APIs, such as ChatGPT and Wit.ai, to enhance application functionality.
- **Teamwork and Problem Solving**: This project highlighted the importance of communication and teamwork in solving complex technical issues and ensuring successful project delivery.



## **Future Directions**

### **Next Steps and Improvements**
Looking forward, the team plans to:
- **Refine Voice Recognition**: Enhance the accuracy and reliability of voice recognition, making it more responsive and intuitive for users with different speech patterns and accents.
- **Improve Passthrough Functionality**: Further optimize the passthrough feature for Oculus to create a more seamless and immersive experience for users.
- **Add More Accessibility Features**: Implement additional accessibility features, such as customizable voice output speeds and visual aids for users with visual impairments.
- **Expand to Other Platforms**: Extend the application’s functionality to other virtual reality platforms, increasing its accessibility and usability for a wider audience.
