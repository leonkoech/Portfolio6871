        to design, to development. I got introduced to web accessibility and the parallel development model which emphasizes inclusivity and diversity.\
         During my time at instrument, I worked on unlocked.microsoft.com and design.google.com under the guidance of geniuses in their crafts. \
         I also worked on an internship project which is yet to be released.\
        For unlocked.microsoft.com, I built a component for the front-end to meet some specific specs while maintaining some other components for the CMS. \
        For design.google.com, I built an automation script with python to minimize the time used in component creation (more so because the project used NextJs/ReactJs) \
        and an interface for developers to handle project specific types and prevent errors in their code",

        While at Sustainible, I integrated some API's (stripe,firebase) and helped with others (facebook), created some structure for the project for scalability, core engineering on the structure of data\
        to minimize resources used to read and write data to the backend, created templates for GitHub while reporting directly to the founders\
